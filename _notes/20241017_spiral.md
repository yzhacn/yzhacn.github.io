 I created a **note** entitled ***"From Classical Heisenberg Model to Spiral Magnetism"***, which guides readers through using the Classical Heisenberg Model to determine the conditions under which spiral-magnetic configuration emerges. The note is available in both ***[the Chinese version “从古典海森堡模型到螺旋磁性”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral.pdf)*** and ***[the Japanese version “古典 Heisenberg 模型から螺旋磁性へ”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral_ja.pdf)***, and I apologize that there is currently no English version.
