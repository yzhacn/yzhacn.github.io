 Created a **note** titled ***"From Classical Heisenberg Model to Spiral Magnetism"***, which guides readers through using the classical Heisenberg model to determine the conditions under which spiral magnetic configuration emerges. Available in both the ***[Chinese version “从古典海森堡模型到螺旋磁性”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral.pdf)*** and the ***[Japanese version “古典 Heisenberg 模型から螺旋磁性へ”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral_ja.pdf)***. An English version is not yet available.
