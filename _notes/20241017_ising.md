I created a **note** entitled ***"One-Dimensional Ising Model: Phase Transition, Symmetry Breaking, and the Critical Exponent of Heat Capacity at Constant Volume"***. The note is available in ***[the Chinese version “一维伊辛(Ising)模型: 相变，对称性破缺与定积热容的临界指数”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_ising.pdf)*** only.
