I am a second-year master’s student in the [Department of Condensed Matter Physics](https://www2.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/gs/en/dcmp) at [Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/). (Sapporo city, Hokkaido prefecture, Japan) 

I am strongly interested in **condensed matter physics**, particularly various **magnetism-related phenomena**. 
Currently, I am focusing on the study of **magnetic skyrmion lattices (SkLs)**. 
Magnetic skyrmions, originally proposed by British physicist **Tony Skyrme** in the 1960s, are **topologically stable structures** arising in nonlinear sigma models. 
In condensed matter physics, magnetic skyrmions are considered special types of topological field excitations; more precisely, they correspond to localized topological solutions (topological solitons) in field theory.

The formation of skyrmions typically requires specific interaction mechanisms in materials, such as the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI), magnetic frustration, magnetic anisotropy, and external magnetic fields etc. 
My current research aims to explore whether other specific interaction mechanisms may also contribute to the emergence of magnetic skyrmions.

In addition to physics, I am enthusiastic about assembling and maintaining high-performance workstations for scientific computing. 
High-performance workstations are essential for large-scale parallel numerical simulations, and I am planning to build a small computing cluster by integrating multiple workstations to enhance computational efficiency.

Notes
======
* 2024.10.17 I created a **note** entitled *"From Classical Heisenberg Model to Spiral Magnetism"*, which guides readers through using the Classical Heisenberg Model to determine the conditions under which spiral-magnetic configuration emerges. The note is available in both *[the Chinese version “从古典海森堡模型到螺旋磁性”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral.pdf)* and *[the Japanese version “古典 Heisenberg 模型から螺旋磁性へ”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_spiral_ja.pdf)*, and I apologize that there is currently no English version.

* 2024.10.17 I created a **note** entitled *"One-Dimensional Ising Model: Phase Transition, Symmetry Breaking, and the Critical Exponent of Heat Capacity at Constant Volume"*. The note is available in *[the Chinese version “一维伊辛(Ising)模型: 相变，对称性破缺与定积热容的临界指数”](https://yzhacn.github.io/files/20241017_ising.pdf)* only.
