I am a second-year master’s student in the **[Department of Condensed Matter Physics](https://www2.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/gs/en/dcmp)** at **[Hokkaido University](https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/)**. (Sapporo city, Hokkaido prefecture, Japan) 

I am strongly interested in **condensed matter physics**, particularly various **magnetism-related phenomena**. 
Currently, I am focusing on the study of **magnetic skyrmion lattices (SkLs)**. 
Magnetic skyrmions, originally proposed by British physicist **Tony Skyrme** in the 1960s, are **topologically stable structures** arising in nonlinear sigma models. 
In condensed matter physics, magnetic skyrmions are considered special types of topological field excitations; more precisely, they correspond to localized topological solutions (topological solitons) in field theory.

The formation of skyrmions typically requires specific interaction mechanisms in materials, such as the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI), magnetic frustration, magnetic anisotropy, and external magnetic fields etc. 
My current research aims to explore whether other specific interaction mechanisms may also contribute to the emergence of magnetic skyrmions.

In addition to physics, I am enthusiastic about assembling and maintaining high-performance workstations for scientific computing. 
High-performance workstations are essential for large-scale parallel numerical simulations, and I am planning to build a small computing cluster by integrating multiple workstations to enhance computational efficiency.
