excerpt: 'Abstract: We report the emergence of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice in multiorbital
*f*-electron systems with easy-axis magnetic anisotropy on a centrosymmetric
square lattice. By performing mean-field calculations for an effective
localized model consisting of two Kramers doublets, we construct the
low-temperature phase diagram in a static external magnetic field.
Consequently, we find that a square-shaped skyrmion lattice with the skyrmion
number of one appears in the intermediate-field region when the crystal field
splitting between the two doublets is small. Furthermore, we identify another
double-*Q* state with a nonzero net scalar chirality at zero- and low-field
regions, which is attributed to the help of the multiorbital degree of
freedom. Our results offer another route to search for skyrmion-hosting
materials in centrosymmetric *f*-electron tetragonal systems with multiorbital
degrees of freedom, e.g., Ce-based compounds. This contrasts with conventional
other *f*-electron systems hosting skyrmion lattices, such as Gd- and Eu-based
compounds without orbital angular momentum.'
