excerpt: 'Abstract: Motivated by recent theoretical predictions of a square-shaped skyrmion lattice (S-SkL) in centrosymmetric tetragonal Ce-based magnets
[Yan Zha and Satoru Hayami, Phys. Rev. B **111**, 165155 (2025)}], we perform a comprehensive theoretical investigation
on the role of multiorbital effects, magnetic anisotropy, and momentum-based frustrated exchange interactions in stabilizing such topologically nontrivial 
magnetic textures.
By employing self-consistent mean-field calculations over a broad range of model parameters, we demonstrate that the cooperative interplay among multiorbital effects, frustrated exchange interactions at higher-harmonic wave vectors, and crystal-field anisotropy is crucial for the stabilization of the S-SkL. 
Furthermore, the competition between the easy-plane intraorbital
coupling and the easy-axis interorbital 
coupling leads to a significant enhancement of the S-SkL stability region. 
We also identify a plethora of multi-*Q* states, including magnetic bubble lattice and double-*Q* phases with a local/global scalar chirality.
Our findings elucidate the microscopic mechanism responsible for the emergence of S-SkLs in Ce-based magnets and provide a route toward realizing skyrmion lattices in a broader class of *f*-electron materials beyond conventional Gd- and Eu-based systems lacking orbital angular momentum.'
